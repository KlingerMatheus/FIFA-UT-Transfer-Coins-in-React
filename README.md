	<h2>Objective</h2>
	<p>This is a new version of the tool i created before with Vue.js. I'm practicing React because i am migrating from Vue.js, so i had the idea to develop a version of this tool to practice with React and improve my skills.</p>
	<p>The tool was developed to help me on enhancing with calculations, precisely and faster to sell Coins of the game FIFA to my customers. In the end of the sell i used to take a print to show how is the process and to prove them that everything was doing correctly.</p>
